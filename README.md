#### Scheduling Options

The image has capability of executing tasks at differnt times of the day. It follows the [cron syntax](https://cron.help/). Presently this image only supports the busybox cron however can be extended to other scheduling backends with little effort.

| Parameter                       | Description                         | Default          |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_SCHEDULING`   | Enable Scheduled Tasks              | `TRUE`           |
| `CONTAINR_SCHEDULING_BACKEND`   | What scheduling tool to use `cron`  | `cron`           |
| `CONTAINER_SCHEDULING_LOCATION` | Where to read task files            | `/assets/cron/`  |
| `SCHEDULING_LOG_TYPE`           | Log Type `FILE`                     | `FILE`           |
| `SCHEDULING_LOG_LOCATION`       | Log File Location                   | `/var/log/cron/` |
| `SCHEDULING_LOG_LEVEL`          | Log Level `1` (loud) to `8` (quiet) | `6`              |

##### Cron Options

There are two ways to add jobs to be triggered via cron. One is to drop files into `/assets/cron/` which will be parsed upon container startup, or to set environment variables.

| Parameter | Description                                            | Default |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `CRON_*`  | Name of the job value of the time and output to be run |         |

Example: `CRON_HELLO="* * * * * echo 'hello' > /tmp/hello.log`

Since you can't really disable environment variables in Docker if they are baked into parent Docker images, you can override a baked in Cron command with your own values, or to disable it entirely set the value to `FALSE` eg `CRON_HELLO=FALSE`.

#### Messaging Options

If you wish to send mail, set `CONTAINER_ENABLE_MESSAGING=TRUE` and configure the following environment variables. Presently we only support one backend, but more can be added with little effort.

| Parameter                     | Description                                | Default |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_MESSAGING`  | Enable Messaging services like SMTP        | `TRUE`  |
| `CONTAINER_MESSAGING_BACKEND` | Messaging Backend - presently only `msmtp` | `msmtp` |
##### MSMTP Options

for information about the following Zabbix values.

#### Monitoring Options
This image includes the capability of using agents inside the image to monitor metrics from applications. Presently at this time it only supports Zabbix as a monitoring platform, however is extendable to other platforms with little effort.

Drop files in `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf.d` to setup your metrics. The environment variables below only affect the system end of the configuration. If you wish to use your own system configuration without these variables, change `ZABBIX_SETUP_TYPE` to `MANUAL`

#### Logging Options

This is work in progress for a larger logging solution. Presently there is functionality to rotate logs on a daily basis, however as this section matures there will be the capability to also ship the logs to an external data warehouse like Loki, or Elastic Search. At present Log shipping is only supported by `fluent-bit` and x86_64 only.

#### Permissions

If you wish to change the internal id for users and groups you can set environment variables to do so.
e.g. If you add `USER_NGINX=1000` it will reset the containers `nginx` user id from `82` to `1000` -

If you enable `DEBUG_PERMISSIONS=TRUE` all the users and groups have been modified in accordance with
environment variables will be displayed in output.

Hint, also change the Group ID to your local development users UID & GID and avoid Docker permission issues when developing.

| Parameter                        | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONTAINER_USER_<USERNAME>`      | The user's UID in /etc/passwd will be modified with new UID                 |
| `CONTAINER_GROUP_<GROUPNAME>`    | The group's GID in /etc/group and /etc/passwd will be modified with new GID |
| `CONTAINER_GROUP_ADD_<GROUPNAME>` | The username will be added in /etc/group after the group name defined       |

#### Process Watchdog

This is experimental functionality to call an external script before a process is executed.

Sample use cases:

- Alert slack channel when process has executed more than once
- Disable process from executing further if restarted 50 times
- Write to an additional log file..
- Change a file to display "Under Maintenance" on a webserver if this process isn't supposed to be run more than 1 time.


It will pass 5 arguments to a bash script titled the same name as the executing script or if not found, use the default `CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_SCRIPT` below. Drop your files into the `CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_PATH`.

For example, if `04-scheduling` was starting, it would look for `$CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_PATH/04-scheduling` and if found execute it while passing the following arguments: DATE,TIME,SCRIPT_NAME,TIMES EXECUTED,HOSTNAME

e.g: `2021-07-01 23:01:04 04-scheduling 2 container`

Use the values in your own bash script using the `$1` `$2` `$3` `$4` `$5` syntax.
Change time and date and settings with these environment variables

| Parameter                           | Description                           | Default                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| `CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_SCRIPT`   | Default helper script name            | `processhelper.sh`                 |
| `CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_DATE_FMT` | Date format passed to external script | `%Y-%m-%d`                         |
| `CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_TIME_FMT` | Time format passed to external script | `%H:%M:%S`                         |

### Networking

The following ports are exposed.

| Port    | Description  |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `10050` | Zabbix Agent |

## Developing / Overriding

This base image has been used over a hundred times to successfully build secondary images. My methodology is admittedly straying from the "one process per container" rule, however this methodology allows me to put together images at a rapid pace, and if more complex scalability is required, the work is split into their own individual images. Since you are reading this here's a crash course at how the image works: (WIP):

See `/assets/functions/00-container` for more detailed documentation for the various commands and functions/shortcuts

- Put defaults in `/assets/defaults/(script name)`
- Put functions in `/assets/functions/(script name)`
- Put Initialization script in `/etc/cont-init.d/(script name)`

  Put at the top:

````bash
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash          # Pull in Container Environment Variables from Dockerfile/Docker Runtime
source /assets/functions/00-container # Pull in all custom container functions from this image
prepare_service single                # Read functions and defaults only from files matching this script filename - see detailed docs for more
PROCESS_NAME="process"                # set the prefix for any logging

.. your scripting ..
print_info "This an INFO log"
print_warn "This a WARN log"
print_error "This is a ERROR log"

liftoff                               # this writes to the state files at /tmp/state to prove the script executed properly see CONTAINER_SKIP_SANITY_CHECK
````

- Put Services script in `/etc/services.available/(script name)`

  Put at the top:

````bash
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash          # Pull in Container Environment Variables from Dockerfile/Docker Runtime
source /assets/functions/00-container # Pull in all custom container functions from this image
prepare_service defaults single       # Read defaults only from files matching this script filename - see detailed docs for more
PROCESS_NAME="process"                # set the prefix for any logging

check_container_initialized           # Check to make sure that the container properly initialized before proceeding
check_service_initialized init        # Check to see if the cont-init.d/scriptname executed correctly, otherwise wait until it has done
liftoff                               # Prove script was able to execute properly

print_start "Starting processname"    # Show STARTING log prefix, and also show if enabled a counter, and execute process watchdog script
fakeprocess (args)                    # whatever your process you want to start is
````

| Parameter                         | Description                                                                    | Default     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `DEBUG_MODE`                      | Enable debug mode and show all script output                                   | `FALSE`     |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_DOCKER_SECRETS` | Check Docker Secrets when checking for environment variables                   | `TRUE`      |
| `CONTAINER_SKIP_SANITY_CHECK`     | Skip the checking to see if all scripts in /etc/cont-init.d executed correctly | `FALSE`     |
| `DEBUG_MODE`                      | Show all script output (set -x)                                                | `FALSE`     |
| `PROCESS_NAME`                    | Used for prefixing the script that is running                                  | `container` |

## Debug Mode

When using this as a base image, create statements in your startup scripts to check for existence of `DEBUG_MODE=TRUE`
and set various parameters in your applications to output more detail, enable debugging modes, and so on.
In this base image it does the following:

* Sets zabbix-agent to output logs in verbosity
* Shows all script output (equivalent to set -x)

## Maintenance

### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

``bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is) bash
``
## Support

These images were built to serve a specific need in a production environment and gradually have had more functionality added based on requests from the community.
### Usage
- The [Discussions board](../../discussions) is a great place for working with the community on tips and tricks of using this image.
### Bugfixes
- Please, submit a [Bug Report](issues/new) if something isn't working as expected. I'll do my best to issue a fix in short order.

### Feature Requests
- Feel free to submit a feature request, however there is no guarantee that it will be added, or at what timeline.

### Updates
- Best effort to track upstream changes, More priority if I am actively using the image in a production environment.
